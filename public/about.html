<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I was born in Ontario, Oregon on July 28, 2000. lived in Idaho for 16 yr. before moving
  to Atmore, Alabama.</p>
    <p>I have sold produce at a corn stand, worked for a
  produce farmer, ran a weekly stand at a large craft and farmers market,
  harvested microgreens, worked in a greenhouse, spent 6 months volenteering at a hospital in 2021-2022, and worked in the office
  at a glass repair and replacement shop. I've had many adventures along
  the way.</p>
    <p>In 2023, I got diagnosed with autism. So many things that I struggle
  now makes sense.</p>
    <p>Now I would like to learn how to code. I've always
  thought it would be enjoyable. But <emp>finally</emp> I am actually doing it!!
  looking forward to all the computer hours, crunching code and trying
  to debug. i look forward to every step. Hopefully someday down the
  road I can actually get a job doing what I enjoy!
